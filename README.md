# Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) Examples
**Alejandro Escontrela**

A set of simple examples demonstrating the utility of the differential
dynamic programming algorithm as applied to various dynamical systems.

## How to run:
Navigate into an example's subdirectory and run `main` from the MatLab
command window. 

To observe the bundle of trajectories generated by the
addition of random noise to the system, run `visualize_bundles` in the
command window.
